        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML stands for hypertext markup language and provides basic strcture to the webpage</li>
          <li>h1, h2, h3, etc. elements are all headers, h1 being the biggest, and becoming smaller as you go. They are important for screen readers</li>
          <li>Head element is all metadata, stuff the user will not see, other than the title.</li>
          <li>Body element is all the actual content on the webpage that user sees and interacts with.</li>
          <li>A img element has two parts: src="" which has the source of the image, being from the internet or a local file. and alt="" which holds the descripton of the imager for screen readers and search engines (very important)</li>
          <li>There are two types of list. Unordered list (ul) (like this one) has bullet points. The other is an Ordererd List (ol) and has numbers. Every  line in the list starts with li</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git is a version control program that works together with github to make it much easier to work with others and make sure to not break your website by using branches of the main site.</li>
          <li>Some console commands to remember are: ls: stands for list. Displays files and directories</li>
          <li>cd: Stands for change directory. Can be used to navigate directories in computer.
            Example: "cd c/Users/(user)/dowloads" will go to my downloads folder
              "cd /" will go to the very surface level of the pc.
              "cd .." will go one level up.</li>
            <li>"mkdir (name)" will make a directory/folder with that name.</li>
            <li>"touch (name)" will make a file with that name.</li>
            <li>"start (filename)" will start a file as if you double clicked on it.</li>
            <li>Now for actual git commands: git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
            <li>git checkout (branch name): switches current working branch to the one typed in angled brackets </li>
            <li>git pull origin main: pulls project from most current main branch.</li>
            <li>git checkout -b (new branch): makes a new branch and switches current working branch to that one</li>
        </ul>
